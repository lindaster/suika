		<p><strong>Imagine Acordes Ukulele</strong>. Videos you watch may be added to the TVs watch history and influence TV recommendations. DU - DU - DU - DU is the suggested strumming pattern for Imagine. In his memory as the Beatles nut I am I spent yesterday evening figuring out the chords to Imagine - strangely a song I had never tried on the uke before. Strictly speaking this should be Dm7 which I have shown in the guitar version but on the ukulele F works well as it produces the descending note pattern which is heard in the song and all the notes of the F chord are included in a Dm7 chord.</p>
